A JSON-RPC Haskell client for the Factom protocol. Each response has special ADT(algebraic data type) that automatically converted from JSON response. Using [Remote Monad](https://ku-fpg.github.io/files/Gill-15-RemoteMonad.pdf) pattern multiple request can be batched and executed simulatenously, following more robust approach and reducing usage of expensive RPC calls.

Choosing a batching strategy. There are two strategies:
- `Weak`   - a single command or a single procedure, or
- `Strong` - a sequence of commands, optionally terminated by a procedure

# Installation

You can install package from [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/api-rpc-factom) and build with Cabal, but we recommend to use [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) tool. Add to you dependencies in stack.yaml and cabal file dependency `- api-rpc-factom`.

To run and test from repository

1. Build with stack
```bash
$ stack build
```
2. Load REPL with stack for evaluation
```
$ stack repl
```

3. execute required methods

## Usage

for basic daemon functionality import with

```haskell
import Factom.RPC.Api
```

for wallet functionality


```haskell
import Factom.RPC.Wallet
```

#### Retreiving a balance
```haskell
-- build communication session
let s = weakSession (traceSendAPI "" $ clientSendAPI endpoint)

-- run Remote Monad
h <- send s $ do
         -- run specific events by executing exposed
         h <- reqFactoidBalance "EC2dTBH2Nc9t9Y7RFD3FYMN5ottoPeHdk6xqUWEc6eHVoBPj6CmHx"
         return h
-- show converted ADT
print h
-- or use for special business logic
```

#### Reading Entry Data
```haskell
-- build communication session
let s = weakSession (traceSendAPI "" $ clientSendAPI endpoint)

-- run Remote Monad
h <- send s $ do
         -- run specific events by executing exposed
         h <- reqEntryData "61b3d3175f211f3b23b455bb8710fdbcf545cb40da397d9e20b26eca31c389a6"
         return h
-- show converted ADT
print h
-- or use for special business logic
```

#### Writing an Entry
```haskell
-- build communication session
let s = weakSession (traceSendAPI "" $ clientSendAPI endpoint)

-- run Remote Monad
(c,c',r) <- send s $ do
         -- run specific events by executing exposed
         c <- reqComposeEntry "48e0c94d00bf14d89ab10044075a370e1f55bcb28b2ff16206d865e192827645"
                              "EC2DKSYyRcNWf7RS963VFYgMExo1824HVeCfQ9PGPmNzwrcmgm2r"
         c'<- reqCommitEntry "00015507C1024BF5C956749FC3EBA4ACC60FD485FB100E601070A44FCCE54FF358D60669854734013B6A27BCCEB6A42D62A3A8D02A6F0D73653215771DE243A63AC048A18B59DA29F4CBD953E6EBE684D693FDCA270CE231783E8ECC62D630F983CD59E559C6253F84D1F54C8E8D8665D493F7B4A4C1864751E3CDEC885A64C2144E0938BF648A00"
         r <- reqRevealEntry "007E18CCC911F057FB111C7570778F6FDC51E189F35A6E6DA683EC2A264443531F000E0005746573745A0005746573745A48656C6C6F20466163746F6D21"
         return (c,c',r)
-- show converted ADT
print h
-- or use for special business logic
```

#### Block Height and Current Minute

```haskell
-- build communication session
let s = weakSession (traceSendAPI "" $ clientSendAPI endpoint)

-- run Remote Monad
h <- send s $ do
         -- run specific events by executing exposed
         h <- reqGetHeight
         m <- reqCurrentMinute
         return (h,m)
-- show converted ADT
print h
-- or use for special business logic
```

#### Sending A Transaction

```haskell
-- build communication session
let s = weakSession (traceSendAPI "" $ clientSendAPI endpoint)

-- preate input
let txname        = "test1234"
    inputAddress  = "FA2jK2HcLnRdS94dEcU27rF3meoJfpUcZPSinpb7AwQvPRY6RL1Q"
    inputAmount   = 1000012000
    outputAddress = "FA2yeHMMJR6rpjRYGe3Q4ogThHUmByk3WLhTjQDvPrxDoTYF8BbC"
    outputAmount  = 1000000000

-- run Remote Monad
t <- send s $ do
         -- run specific events by executing exposed
         t <- reqSendTransaction txname inputAddress inputAmount outputAddress outputAmount
         return t
-- show converted ADT
print h
-- or use for special business logic
```

## Testing

You can load REPL with `stack repl` and evaluate functionality with real-time feedback using examples provided above.

## Development

To contribute to the library, clone the repository, create a feature branch and submit a PR to the `devel` branch. Once approved and tested it will be streamlined to `master` i.e upstream.

## Contributions

The Library developed by Kompendium, LLC in partnership with Kelecorix, Inc and Sergey Bushnyak for the good of the Factom community. While we see the usage of the libraries over the months, the Factom community decided not to support this work in the form of a grant either upfront or as backpay on multiple occasions ([1](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/kompendium-12-back-pay-two-factom-community-sdks-client-libraries-php-ruby.4802/), [2](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/kompendium-12-back-pay-ruby-haskell-client-libraries-for-the-factom-blockchain.2740/), [3](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/back-pay-development-of-4-json-rpc-client-libraries-to-the-factom-community.2513/))
